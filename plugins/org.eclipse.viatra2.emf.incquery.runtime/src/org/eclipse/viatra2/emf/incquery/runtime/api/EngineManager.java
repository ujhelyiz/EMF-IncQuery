/**
 * Global registry of active EMF-IncQuery engines.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Manages an {@link IncQueryEngine} for each EMF model, that is created on demand.
 * Managed engines are shared between clients querying the same EMF model. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to create private, unmanaged engines that are not shared between clients.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Only weak references are retained on the managed engines. 
 * So if there are no other references to the matchers or the engine, 
 * they can eventually be GC'ed, 
 * and they won't block the EMF model from being GC'ed either.
